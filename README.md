# ConfessionBot
A university assignment to create a project in Processing, this was mine and my group's project. I did most of the coding and had a blast even if I'd like to go back and improve upon the code.

The point of the project was to create a twitter bot that popularizes people's confessions. People often post confessions but without a big following it is rare these get seen by other people. This bot tried to break that link.

Of course - the bot never gained traction because it only ran temporarily. I have cleaned out the API tokens due to sensitive information.
